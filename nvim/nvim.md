# NeoVim

The config needs to be placed in `~/.config/nvim/init.vim`.  

For plugin installation I use `vim-plug`, which should be installed automatically while loading the config.  

The only dependency for the plugins is NERDFonts, see how to install them [here](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts).  

### Shortcuts
The few (custom) shortcuts I use are:  

`C-f` - toggle NERDTree  
`++` - toggle NERDCommenter (visual and plain)  
`C-ww` - switch to next split  
`gt` - next tab  
`gT` - previous tab  

In NERDTree:  
`t` - open in new tab  
`s` - open in new split  
`ma` - create new node (file) under dir  
`I`- show hidden files  

CoC (auto-completion) works like:  
`TAB` - next suggestion  
`Shift-TAB` - previous suggestion  
`C-space` - select completion
