# ZSH (z-shell)

The file should be placed in the home dir.  
I use `oh-my-zsh` as my plugin manager, for installation [see](https://ohmyz.sh/).

> Note: the config-file will be replaced during the installation.

Check the plugin list for the packages, which need to be installed.  

**package manager**:
- zsh
- z
- git
- tmux
- neovim

**manually**:  
The default directory for manual plugins is `~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins/`.  
The `autosuggestions` plugin needs to be cloned in this directory.  
https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions  

`tmux` will autostart with this config.  
`nvim` can be called with the `vim` alias.
